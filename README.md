# simpletope 0.2.1
> No more scripting required to integrate isotope into your website! This plugin uses HTML5 attributes rather then JS codes. It also supports hashes so you can directly link to a filter.

## Bower
Install with Bower: ``bower install simpletope``

## NodeJS

### Getting Started
If you haven't used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) guide, as it explains how to [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). Once you're familiar with that process, install the required plugins with this command in the root of your project:

```shell
npm install
```
